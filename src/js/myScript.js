It brings along a new, faster Apple A11 Bionic system chip and a display supporting Apple's True Tone display technology. The dual camera at the back now shoots 4K video at up to 60fps and takes portraits with studio lighting effects. The addition of optical image stabilization to the 2X zoom Telephoto camera should translate to clearer images and portraits. iOS 11 runs on it out of the box, introducing augmented reality applications, a redesigned App Store, a new Control Center layout, and a number of UI refinements";

Despite the phone's smaller size, which may lead to increased thermal throttling, the SE's A15 SoC runs at the same peak CPU frequencies as the iPhone 13. Like its predecessor, the third-generation iPhone SE does not feature a standard 3.5 mm stereo headphone jack and keeps a home button.";
